# React + TypeScript + Vite Project

This project is a React application bootstrapped with Vite, using TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features. It includes essential tools and configurations for a robust development environment.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **React Router**: For handling routing in the application.
- **React Query**: For fetching, caching, and updating data.
- **React Helmet Async**: For managing document head tags.
- **ESLint**: For code linting and maintaining code quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

### Linting

To lint the codebase, use:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `routes/`: Application routing configuration.
  - `index.css`: Global styles.
  - `main.tsx`: Entry point of the application.

## ESLint Configuration

The project uses ESLint with a custom configuration to enforce code quality and style. The configuration includes:

- TypeScript-aware linting rules.
- React-specific linting rules.
- Stylistic rules for consistent code formatting.
